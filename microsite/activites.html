                    <p>Cades Cove Loop Road is an exception. The 11-mile one-way road is a popular bicycling area. Cades Cove access is motor vehicle-free all day on Wednesdays from May through September to provide opportunities for pedestrians and cyclists to experience Cades Cove without motor vehicles. During summer and fall, bicycles may be rented at the campground store.</p>

                    <p>Every year, over 200,000 visitors hike well-worn trails to view Grotto, Laurel, Abrams, Rainbow, and other popular waterfalls in the park. Large waterfalls attract the crowds, but smaller cascades and falls can be found on nearly every river and stream in the park.The Great Smoky Mountains is covered with waterfalls—ample rainfall and an elevation gradient. </p>

                    <p>Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a world-renowned preserve of wildflower diversity—over 1,500 kinds of flowering plants are found in the park, more than in any other North American national park. You can see where to find many of these flowers on the Species Mapper. In fact, the park is sometimes referred to as the “Wildflower National Park.”</p>
